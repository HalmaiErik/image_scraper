# image_scraper
 This is a project done while doing "The Complete Python 3 Course: Beginner to Advanced" by Joseph Delgadillo and Nick Germaine
 It can be found here: https://www.udemy.com/course/python-complete/
 
 This is a Bing image scraper, that can be used on Windows. When launching, you will need to enter the desired searched term. Once entered, the application will search for it on Bing's image searcher and it will download all the resulted images to a folder inside the project's working directory. It can be used as a wallpaper finder or as a fast way to download many pictures at once.
